# Spyro the Dragon

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The order of access for homeworlds is shuffled. The starting home world can be shuffled, so you start somewhere besides
the Artisans from a new save file. The goal is to reach and defeat Gnasty Gnorc.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

The available items grant access to levels and homeworlds. Locations include reaching each 25% threshold for a level's
gems, every 500 gem increment of total gems collected, dragons rescued, and eggs collected.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Level access, homeworld access, filler items, and traps can all be shuffled anywhere into the multiworld.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

In the case of receiving homeworld access, the player will be able to choose the given homeworld in the balloonist'
menu. In the case of receiving level access, a level portal will transport a player into the level instead of leading
back to the homeworld. There is currently no other in-game indication or sound effect on receiving an item.
