# Spyro the Dragon

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The order of access for homeworlds is shuffled. The starting home world can be shuffled, so you start somewhere besides
the Artisans from a new save file. The goal is to reach and defeat Gnasty Gnorc, or to reach the vortex in Gnasty's
Loot. The portal names and inventory screen reflect whether you have the access items to enter a portal or a homeworld.
Inaccessible homeworlds or portals have the first letter replaced with a ., accessible ones with unchecked locations
with a !, and accessible ones that have been completed will have their names as normal.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

The available items grant access to portals and homeworlds. Locations include reaching each 25% threshold for a level's
gems, every 500 gem increment of total gems collected, vortexes reached, and Gnasty Gnorc defeated. Access to Gnasty's
World requires five MacGuffins named after the bosses of the other homeworlds: Toasty's Stilts, Shemp's Staff,
Blowhard's Beard, Metalhead's Mohawk, and Jacques' Ribbon.

Dragons rescued and eggs collected locations are planned, but not yet implemented.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Level access, homeworld access, boss-themed MacGuffins, filler items, and traps can all be shuffled anywhere into the
multiworld.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

In the case of receiving homeworld access, the player will be able to choose the given homeworld in the balloonist'
menu. In the case of receiving level access, a level portal will be traversible, instead of acting like a solid wall.
A portal's name will have an apostrophe for the first letter as long as the portal isn't both accessible and the
level it leads to hasn't had all its checks completed. The inventory screen will update and show a more concise
indicator for access to and completion of levels and homeworlds.
